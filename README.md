# ADHD Tools

Experimenting with tools to help manage ADHD.

First project: something to take voice notes, using speech to text (STT), with the ability to action them, based on a simple command syntax, rather than using any form of machine learning (ML) to "understand" the words beyond the STT.

## Technologies:
* Python
    * Caster
    * Dragonfly
    * Kaldi
    * Click
    * Flask
